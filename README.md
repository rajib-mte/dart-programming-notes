# Dart Language Learning Roadmap 🚀

This repository documents my complete learning journey of the **Dart programming language**.  
It follows a structured roadmap from **basic concepts to advanced topics**, with examples and practice code.

Dart is a powerful, object-oriented language used mainly for **Flutter app development** and **backend/server-side applications**.

---

## 📌 Why Dart?
- Easy to learn (C/C++-like syntax)
- Strongly typed & null-safe
- Used in Flutter for cross-platform apps
- Supports OOP, async programming, and collections

---

## 🛣️ Dart Learning Roadmap

### 🔹 1. Basics of Dart
- Introduction to Dart
- Dart SDK & tools
- Variables and data types
- Keywords and identifiers
- Comments in Dart
- Input & Output
- Type inference (`var`, `dynamic`)

---

### 🔹 2. Data Types
- int
- double
- String
- bool
- num
- dynamic
- final & const

---

### 🔹 3. Operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- Assignment operators
- Increment & decrement operators

---

### 🔹 4. Control Flow
- if / else
- else if
- switch-case
- break & continue

---

### 🔹 5. Loops
- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop
- for-in loop

---

### 🔹 6. Functions
- Function declaration
- Return types
- Arrow functions
- Optional parameters
- Named parameters
- Anonymous functions (lambda)

---

### 🔹 7. Collections in Dart
- List
- Set
- Map
- List vs Set vs Map
- Iteration using loops
- Collection methods

---

### 🔹 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class and object
- Constructor
- Named constructor
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

---

### 🔹 9. Null Safety
- Nullable vs non-nullable variables
- `?`, `!`, and `late` keyword
- Null-aware operators (`??`, `?.`)

---

### 🔹 10. Exception Handling
- try-catch
- finally
- throw
- Custom exceptions

---

### 🔹 11. Asynchronous Programming
- Future
- async & await
- then()
- Stream (basic idea)

---

### 🔹 12. Advanced Concepts
- Mixins
- Enums
- Generics
- Extensions
- Typedef

---

## 🧪 Practice & Examples
- Each topic contains simple examples
- Focus on logic building
- Beginner-friendly structure

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Dart SDK
- VS Code
- Command Line
- Online resources & practice platforms

---

## 🎯 Goal
To build a **strong Dart foundation** for:
- Flutter mobile app development
- Backend and server-side programming
- Competitive programming and logic building
